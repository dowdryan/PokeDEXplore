In this step, you'll document your site and what tools you used to make it in a Markdown file called README.md - this file will be collected with the rest of your work on GitHub. Follow the instructions given below closely. When you are done, submit a link to your finalized GitHub below. This is your final submission. Your mentor will review your project and discuss it with you on your next call. Congratulations!

- PokeApi
- Axios
- Jest (For Testing)
- Menu Sprites (From projectpokemon.org)

- Some Pokemon are too new, hence some sprites may not be available yet.

Functionality I couldn't include:
 - Updating abilities, types, etc. based on forms. I could only do the sprites.
